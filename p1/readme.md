## Notes for instructor
*I wanted my challenge function to take the word or phrase that was inputted and spit out an anagram. I installed aspell on my machine, but didn't have any successful runs with the tests. I think some of this work with the Pspell/Aspell dictionary attempts can be seen on branches of the project.*
